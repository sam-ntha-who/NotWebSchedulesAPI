###What is this?
This is a surgical employee scheduling application, inspired by one that was in use in the operating room that I worked in years ago. It will handle staff schedules, including daily assignments, on-call assignments, shift trades, vacation allocation, as well as the output of many different documents that allow for easy integration with the application. The main objective is ease of use and intuitive controls for quick input of data.

##Why?
For reasons unknown to me, the original app was no longer supported (by the creator) and the OR started using excel and a nurse scheduling app. It is not a good replacement at all and makes those needing to deal with schedules do about 10x the work of the app. This is created in the hopes that a new app can make the lives of the schedulers a little bit easier.

##WebApp
The repository for the webapp is here: https://github.com/sam-ntha-who/NotWebSchedulesAPI/tree/main

##API
This is the API to provide CRUD functions as well as a web application to access the data through a UI. If using/testing locally, you will need to run both at the same time, on different ports.

###Database
Currently this is set up for use with MongoDB but can be switched out in favor of other database types. In addition, I will be exploring storing data in excel documents and possibly other local/cloud options.
